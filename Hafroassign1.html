   <h1> Introduction to HTML</h1>
   <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a webpage and its's content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraph, a list of bulleted 
   points or using images and data tables.</p>
   <h2 id="second"> So what is HTML?</h2>
   <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
   professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
   literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) , written in 45 BC.</p>
